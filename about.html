      <p>We are a research team from Boston College interested about online reputation. The principal investigator is Pr. Marios Kokkodis, Assistant Professor of Informations Systems at Boston College. The co-principal investigator is Caroline Caltagirone, Research Project Manager at Boston College and Harvard University. This project is funded by Boston College.</p>

          <h5>For you</h5>
          <p>We gather your online profiles to calculate your overall reputation score on the Internet and we give you recommendations to improve it.</p>
          <h5>For research purpose</h5>
          <p>We want to test whether reputation is transferable between online peer-to-peer platforms. A platform is a website and/or app that puts into contact suppliers and consumers of a product or service. On a peer-to-peer platform, the suppliers and consumers are peers, in other words people like you and me and not companies. These platforms are present in every aspect of our life from lodging and transportation to lending and working, as well as content sharing and many other activities ; famous names are for example Youtube, Uber, Lyft, Airbnb, eBay etc.</p>

        <div class="panel-body" id="justify">
          <p>Trust is crucial in every economic transaction but it is even more true in the case of online transactions. As a result, online platforms implemented reputation systems in order to allow online strangers to trust each others. Research studies proved that these systems increase the number of transactions among online peers. However, we believe they are also source of inefficiency. Indeed, we guess we all have faced this situation when you are new on a platform meaning that nobody ever left a feedback on your profile, your reputation is null and as a consequence, peers on the platform are reluctant to transact with you being for hosting you, sharing a ride with you or buying things from you, etc. And you are frustrated because you know you have an online profile with 5 stars on platform A, you have earned the status of “expert” on platform B, you have a reputation score of 88% on platform C, etc. Yet, you cannot use these reputations it took you time and effort to build on these other platforms because reputation systems are not unified nor portable. But even if they were portable, we are actually not sure that reputation would be transferable from one platform to another because, to the best of our knowledge, nobody has ever proved it. Indeed, does being a super seller on eBay mean anything about you on Upwork? Would you be more willing to host a guest via Couchsurfing who is an ambassador on BlaBlaCar than a guest who is not?</p>

          <p>We want to answer these questions, we want to test reputation transferability across online peer-to-peer platforms. If it does transfer, it means we can reduce information asymmetry among online peers, increase trust in online transactions and as a consequence help the sharing economy foster!</p>

        <div class="panel-heading"><h5>How do we do it?</h5></div>
        <div class="panel-body" id="justify">
          <p>By login on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Instagram and Tumblr thanks to an API (Application Program Interface) and by giving us your usernames on the other platforms, we collect data you authorized us to have access or data that is public. It is important you understand that this data is encrypted and anonymized (see the paragraph about data privacy).</p>
          <h5>For you</h5>
          <p>Then, this data serves as input in our algorithm (a mathematical formula or model if you prefer) to compute the output : your reputation score. For example, inputs can be metrics such as your number of likes on Facebook, your number of connections on LinkedIn, your number of helpful votes on Quora and TripAdvisor, your rating on eBay and BlaBlaCar, your number of positive references on Couchsurfing etc. We also analyze these metrics in order to give you recommendations on how to improve your reputation online.</p>
          <h5>For research purpose</h5>
          <p>Moreover, to answer our research question, we use data about your reputation on platform A, platform B, platform C etc, to predict your reputation on platform Z and we compare our prediction with your actual reputation. If the two reputation scores are close enough, it means reputation is transferable !</p>

          <p>We want to answer these questions, we want to test reputation transferability across online peer-to-peer platforms. If it does transfer, it means we can reduce information asymmetry among online peers, increase trust in online transactions and as a consequence help the sharing economy foster!</p>

          <p>It is really important you understand that we are doing it for research and not commercial purpose. It means that we are very concerned about your privacy and by no means are we going to sell or even share your private data with somebody. Your data is going to be encrypted and anonymized ; in other words, you are only going to be a number such as 14326 for us. </p>
